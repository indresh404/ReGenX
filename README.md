## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for local dev server)
- A modern browser (Chrome / Edge recommended for camera access)

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com//ReGenX.git
cd ReGenX
npm install
npm run serve




## Local development

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Appwrite deployment

Appwrite Sites currently expects your project endpoint and project ID in addition to an API key. The deployment script uses server-side environment variables and keeps secrets out of the browser bundle.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Fill in `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, and `APPWRITE_API_KEY`.
3. Run:

```bash
npm run deploy:appwrite
```

The script will:

- create the Appwrite Site if it does not exist
- upload the current static project as a deployment
- wait for the deployment to finish
- activate the deployment if Appwrite leaves it in `ready`

Never expose a private Appwrite API key in frontend code.
